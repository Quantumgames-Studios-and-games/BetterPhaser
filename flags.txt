# This file contains a couple of options you can set to Phaser Editor 2D.
# The options are the same supported by the PhaserEditor2D.exe program.
# Write PhaserEditor2D.exe -help to see all the options.
# In this file, each option start in a line, and its value in the next line.

# For example, you can change the default HTTP port to 1968.
# Just uncomment (removes the # character) the next lines:
#
# -port
# 1968

# If you have Google Chrome installed, you can open it automatically,
# in the app mode (similar to a desktop application):
#
# -browser-command
# "/usr/bin/google-chrome" "--app=$URL"
